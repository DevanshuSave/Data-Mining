# Data-Mining

Code for classification and clustereing algorithms in Data Mining.

Complete implementations with sample inputs-outputs are programmed in Java.

Python implementations are developed using multiple built-in packages like numpy, scipy

MATLAB implementations were programmed as a part of Data Mining class taken as Masters student at Washington University in St. Louis.
